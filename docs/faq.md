## Magento configuration

### Flush Magento Cache

:::danger[Important]
<kbd class="danger">Flush Magento Cache</kbd> in <kbd>System</kbd> <kbd>Cache Management</kbd> after configuration change!
:::

[Clean and flush cache types](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/manage-cache.html?lang=en#clean-and-flush-cache-types) in the Adobe Commerce Documentation.

### Restore default settings

:::tip[Tip]
Use <kbd>Use System Value</kbd> / <kbd>Use Default</kbd> / <kbd>Use Website</kbd> checkbox to the right of the setting to set the default value.
:::

[Use system value](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/config/scope-change.html?lang=en#use-system-value) in the Adobe Commerce Documentation.

### Module localization and translation

Almost every text string in VCT modules can be translated into any language:

- Copy the module's default translation dictionary for the US locale `vendor/vct/<package name>/i18n/en_US.csv`.
- Rename the default translation dictionary to the required locale e.g. `de_DE.csv`.
- The translation dictionary has the following structure:

    ```csv
    "Source string","Translated string"
    ```
- To do the translation, leave the `Source string` entry unmodified, and translate the `Translated string` e.g.:

  ```csv
  "Add to Cart","Zum Warenkorb hinzufügen"
  "Address","Adresse"
  "Address %1 of %2","Adresse %1 von %2"
  ```
- <kbd class="danger">Flush Magento Cache</kbd> in <kbd>System</kbd> <kbd>Cache Management</kbd> afterwards.

[Translations](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/frontend-core/guide/translations) in the Adobe Commerce Documentation.

### Configurable products configuration

- A configurable product allows the customer to choose options from <kbd>Dropdown</kbd>, <kbd>Multiple Select</kbd>, <kbd>Visual Swatch</kbd> and <kbd>Text Swatch</kbd> input types.
- Configurable child products can be <kbd>Simple</kbd> or <kbd>Virtual</kbd> products without [custom options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/settings/settings-advanced-custom-options.html?lang=en).
- The thumbnail image in the shopping cart can be set to display the image from the configurable product record or from the product variant.
- [Swatch attributes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/product-attributes/swatches.html?lang=en) can be configured to not display corresponding simple product images when the swatch is selected by setting the <kbd>Update Product Preview Image</kbd> option value to <kbd>No</kbd> in <kbd>Stores</kbd> <kbd>ATTRIBUTES</kbd> <kbd>Product</kbd> <kbd>&lt;Attribute&gt;</kbd> <kbd>Attribute Properties</kbd>.
- By default, the theme controls how the <kbd>Image Gallery</kbd> behaves when a customer switches between product variants:
    - <kbd>Blank theme</kbd> replaces the main product image with the image of the selected variant.
    - <kbd>Luma theme</kbd> prepend the selected variant images to the configurable product images.

[Things to remember](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-configurable.html?lang=en#things-to-remember) about configurable products in the Adobe Commerce Documentation.
